"""
Problem Statement:-
Generate count random integer from count to b.
You and your friend have to guess count number between two numbers, count and b.
count and b are inputs taken from the user. Your friend is player 1 and plays first.
He will have to keep choosing the number, and your program must tell whether
the number is greater than the actual number or less than the actual number.
Log the number of trials it took your friend to arrive at the number.
You play the same game, and then the person with the minimum number of trials wins!
Randomly generate count number after taking count and b as input and donâ€™t show that to the user.
